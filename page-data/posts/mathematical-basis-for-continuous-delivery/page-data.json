Report can see the eye-popping stats of high-performaing organizations.\nIt’s easy to dismiss the reports of pushing to production multiple times per day.\nPerhaps you’re thinking “We could do that too if we committed every trivial change we make.”</p>\n<p>You would be wrong.\nThat statement glosses over many complementary practices and technical capabilities that are necessary prerequisites for achieving Continuous Delivery.\nOne of the most important is Product Management, because your Product Owners are responsible for defining the work entering the system.</p>\n<p>In what follows, I hope you take away a fundamental understanding of why you should devote serious attention to the Product Management practices to your software production pipeline as a critical piece of the value-stream within your business.</p>\n<p>To achieve that understanding, we’re going to walk through a thought experiment revolving around two hypothetical almost-identical teams.\nWe’ll take a look at their Product Management process and how (and when) they produce deliverable business value for the customers.\nBy understanding the implications of their process, we’ll also understand the implications of our own processes, and more importantly, understand what we need to do to achieve significant gains in delivering value to the business.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thought-experiment\"

styling a cell in a spreadsheet based on the value in the cell.</p>\n<p>We will look at two different ways to break up the work, and examine the effects each has on how quickly (or slowly) value is delivered to the customer.\nWe will also look at the risks involved, what those risks mean to the business, and how to mitigate the risks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-slow-team\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a

meaningless in and of themselves because they are built on mythical teams and assumptions that don’t pertain to your particular situation.\nThey are only useful in comparing two different scenarios, and getting a feel for what a team can achieve by organizing their work process in such a way to get higher confidence levels as early in the process as possible.\nAnd perhaps more importantly, understanding “why” we can achieve higher productivity by doing so.</p>\n<p>And in case you’re thinking our hypothetical team comparison was a contrived example and the 2.2x differential is unrealistic, I would agree that it’s a super conservative number (you read that correctly, I said conservative).</p>\n<p>If you’re currently working in an environment where E2E testing takes multiple days, or your deployments are stuck behind an outsourced manual testing process, or you have a runbook defining the manual steps to build, package, and deploy your software with a Change Review Board that needs a manual checkpoint review three times along the way, then your potential gain could be orders of magnitude greater.\nJust look at the DORA Report to see what is achievable.</p>\n<h2
